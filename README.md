# Neighborhood Map Project

This was a project that I developed as part of my Udacity [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). The project required me to create a single-page application using React to present a neighborhood map. I used Foursquare's Venue services get a list of locations within the neighborhood, and then used Google Maps to display a map of the neighborhood and to display a marker for each location.

I wrote the HTML, CSS, Javascript and JSX to required make the app beautiful, functional and interactive.

I made use of the [React Google Maps](https://github.com/tomchentw/react-google-maps) integration Components.

## What I Learned
This project gave me an opportunity to practice what I learned in the React Fundamentals and Google Maps API courses as well as in the other courses of my Nanodegree. Essentially this project allowed me to put all the pieces together.

Specifically I practiced:
* creating React components
* using React lifecycle events and the Fetch API to fetch & render external data
* using React's state management
* using Service Workers to cache page content for offline use

## Getting Started
You can try the MyReads app out by doing the following:
* Download the source code
* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* Start the development server with `npm start`
* Go to localhost:3000 in your browser
